[^2]: Despite this Flow Banded Rhyolite is the closest fit I can find[^3] colour and stripewise for rock identification. https://www.geo.mtu.edu/KeweenawGeoheritage/BeachStones/Rhyolite.html
[^3]: Note that Iron Banding creates a similar colour and band but it seems to be on a much larger scale than I have found in my stones.
